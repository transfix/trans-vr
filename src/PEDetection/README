Usage:
Classification	<Input File Name> 
				<Data Resolution X> <Data Resolution Y> <Data Resolution Z>
				<Leaping Number for Output Classified and Original Slices> 
				<Data Type> 
				<Min Value to Clip> 
				<Max Value to Clip> 
				<Window Size>  
				<Number of Clusters> 
				<Output File Name>
				<Swap Byte Order>

<Input File Name>:
Avaiable Input File Types: rawiv, ppm, pgm, raw. "*.raw" have no header

<Leaping Number for Output Classified and Original Slices>:
If the leaping number is 10, then output slices will be 10, 20, 30, and so on.

<Data Type> 
Avaiable Data Types: uchar ushort float

<Min Value to Truncate>:
If the Min Value is 10, then all voxels, which have less than 10, will be zero.

<Max Value to Clip>:
If the Max Value is 100, then all voxels, which have greater than 100, will be zero.

<Window Size>:
This is not used. So, 1 is recommended

<Swap Byte Order>
You should select "yes" or "no"

This program generates several files such as *.gvec, *.GVF, *.Init, and *.second
*.Init file has the initialization information for EM.
