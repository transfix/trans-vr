Tools->MMHLS has two steps to generate Multi-Domain mesh with gaps between any two meshes.
Step 1. generateRawV
Step 2. generateMesh

Step 1 generateRawV implemented two cases.
Case 1. If the input is a classifcation map, the goal is to generate multi-domain mesh.
We need use the Volume Tab. First load this classification map, which must be a rawiv file
format. Each voxel has an integer ID. 
 Three parameters are needed here.
 
 Dimension is an integer, which is the dimension of the  reconstructed volume by higher-order level-set method.
 If the original volume is big, one  need to use a big dimension for mesh quality. 
 
 Edgelength is a parameter used in HLS   reconstruction. If the edgelength is small, more points will be
 generated for reconstructing  the volume. If it's big, fewer points will be used for reconstructing the volume.

 Out Prefix is the output files name, which will be merged into the original volume file name.

 Case 2. If the input is a series of meshes (may have intersections), the goal is to generate non intersecting meshes.
 We need use the Mesh Tab. First load a volume, whose bounding box will be used for reconstructing volume for
 each mesh. Note, this volume must enclose all the meshes. 

 MeshStart is the start mesh id.
 MeshEnd is the end mesh id.
 Mesh Prefix is the mesh file name prefix.
 For example, if you have files foo1.raw, foo2.raw, ...,foo15.raw, MeshStart is 1, MeshEnd is 15, Mesh Prefix is foo.
 The supported file format is raw file, pure geometric file format used in CVC. All the meshes should 
 be in the same folder with the volume that encloses them. 

 Dimension, EdgeLength, Out Prefix are the same as for Case 1.

After this step, the output includes partition surfaces and reconstructed volumes by HLS method and
a manifest text file, which documented the number of domains (first line), each volume, id, iso value, red,
green, blue. 

Step 2. generateMesh.
For this step, we press the generateMesh button directly.
We need first load a manifest file, which is usually geneated by Step 1.

Isovalue Ratio is the ratio of the isovalue used for generating mesh from the volume that Step 1
generated. If ratio is 1, then the isovalue documented in the manifest file will be used. If
 less than 1, the mesh will be smaller. Usually should be [0.9-1].

Tolerance is the gap threshold, [0, ~1]. If it's small, the generated meshes may still include 
intersections. If it's big, the meshes generated will be far. Usually [0, 0.2].

Volume Threshold is a penalty threshold. The extacted meshes from the volumes may include multiple
components. If the volume of one component is less than this threshold, that component will
be removed. This parameter is based on the unit. During the code running, if you find many
small components, you can set it a larger number.

MeshStart is which mesh you want to start.
MeshEnd is the id which you want to end.
Outprefix is output.
E.g, for brain data, we get 41 domains. If I am only intrested in 15-20 domains. MeshStart is 15,
MeshEnd is 20, OutPrefix, say, foo. Then you will get foo15.rawc,..., foo20.rawc. These files
are geometric files with color info. 

Have fun.
