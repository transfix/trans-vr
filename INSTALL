--->
A. Check external libraries required to build full functionality of VolumeRover 2.0
(these libraries will be found by cmake if you have ones installed)

1. Boost (1.41.0 has been tested) - required for basic build
2. GSL (1.15 has been tested)     - required for tiling, volume grid rover, and volutils
3. HDF5 (1.8.5 has been tested)   - required for heirarchical volume handling
4. CGAL (4.0 has been tested)     - required for tiling, segmentation, curation, pockettunnel, skeletonization, secondary structure elucidation, tightcocone, super secondary structure elucidation, and volume grid rover.
5. FFTW (3.2.4 has been tested)   - required for volutils and reconstruction
6. Cg (Nvidia)                    - required for shaded volume rendering

B. Build

To build:
$ cd $BUILD_DIR
$ cmake $SOURCE_DIR
$ make

BUILD_DIR - a location to place files generated during the build.
            It can be the same as the SOURCE_DIR
SOURCE_DIR - The location of the project's root CMakeLists.txt file.

Once you've built the project, the binary will be in bin/ and any libraries
created during the process will be in lib/.

You will likely want to configure some of the build options.
This can be done with the ccmake command:

$ ccmake $SOURCE_DIR
