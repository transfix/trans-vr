--->
A. Check external libraries required to build full functionality of VolumeRover 2.0
(these libraries will be found by cmake if you have ones installed)

Required Libraries:
1. Qt6 (6.4.2+)                   - required for GUI (Qt6 migration is active)
2. Boost (1.70.0+)                - required for basic build
3. GLEW (2.0+)                    - required for OpenGL extensions (now uses system version)
4. OpenGL (3.3+)                  - required for rendering

Optional Libraries:
5. GSL (1.15+)                    - required for tiling, volume grid rover, and volutils
6. HDF5 (1.8.5+)                  - required for heirarchical volume handling
7. CGAL (4.0+)                    - required for tiling, segmentation, curation, pockettunnel, 
                                    skeletonization, secondary structure elucidation, tightcocone, 
                                    super secondary structure elucidation, and volume grid rover
8. FFTW (3.2.4+)                  - required for volutils and reconstruction
9. ImageMagick                    - required for some volume utilities

**Note:** GLEW is now a system dependency. Install libglew-dev (Ubuntu/Debian) 
or glew-devel (Fedora/RHEL). The old bundled GLEW in src/glew/ is no longer used.

B. Build

To build:
$ cd $BUILD_DIR
$ cmake $SOURCE_DIR
$ make

BUILD_DIR - a location to place files generated during the build.
            It can be the same as the SOURCE_DIR
SOURCE_DIR - The location of the project's root CMakeLists.txt file.

Once you've built the project, the binary will be in bin/ and any libraries
created during the process will be in lib/.

You will likely want to configure some of the build options.
This can be done with the ccmake command:

$ ccmake $SOURCE_DIR
